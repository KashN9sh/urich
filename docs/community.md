# Community & getting Urich out there

Urich is open source. You can help others discover it and improve it.

## Contribute code and docs

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/KashN9sh/urich/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to open issues, send PRs, and run tests locally. The [Roadmap](roadmap.md) lists what’s done and what we’re planning.

## Help others discover Urich

- **Star the repo** on GitHub — helps with visibility in search and “trending”.
- **Share** — If you use Urich in a project or a talk, mention it (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, blog, meetup).
- **Write** — A short post or comparison (e.g. “DDD on Starlette with Urich”, “Urich vs FastAPI for CQRS”) on Dev.to, Medium, or your blog.
- **Discuss** — Answer questions about DDD/CQRS/microservices on Reddit (r/python, r/Python), HN, or Discord/Slack; mention Urich when it fits.
- **Packages** — Adapters (Redis event bus, Consul discovery, etc.) as separate packages or in `examples/` help others evaluate the ecosystem.
- **Talks & meetups** — A lightning talk or meetup about “modular DDD on Starlette” can link to Urich. A talk on DDD/microservices on Starlette with a Urich example is a great way to introduce the project. Look for local Python meetups (e.g. meetup.com) or submit to a conference when you have a story to share.

**Showcase:** Used Urich in a project or a talk? Open an issue with the label `showcase` or post in Discussions — we're happy to add you to a list of adopters.

## Where to post (when you have something to show)

- [r/Python](https://reddit.com/r/Python) — “I built / released …” (follow sub rules).
- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) — “Show HN: Urich – async DDD framework for microservices on Starlette”.
- [Python Weekly](https://www.pythonweekly.com) / [Pycoder’s Weekly](https://pycoders.com) — submit a link for “Releases” or “Projects”.
- Twitter/X, Mastodon — tag with #python #ddd #microservices #starlette.

## Where we talk

For now, use **GitHub Issues** for questions, ideas and bug reports. If GitHub Discussions are enabled for the repo, you can use them for open-ended discussion and show-and-tell. A dedicated chat (e.g. Telegram or Discord) may be added later; we’ll link it here.
