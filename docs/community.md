# Community & getting Urich out there

Urich is open source. You can help others discover it and improve it.

## Contribute code and docs

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/KashN9sh/urich/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to open issues, send PRs, and run tests locally.

## Help others discover Urich

- **Star the repo** on GitHub — helps with visibility in search and “trending”.
- **Share** — If you use Urich in a project or a talk, mention it (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, blog, meetup).
- **Write** — A short post or comparison (e.g. “DDD on Starlette with Urich”, “Urich vs FastAPI for CQRS”) on Dev.to, Medium, or your blog.
- **Discuss** — Answer questions about DDD/CQRS/microservices on Reddit (r/python, r/Python), HN, or Discord/Slack; mention Urich when it fits.
- **Packages** — Adapters (Redis event bus, Consul discovery, etc.) as separate packages or in `examples/` help others evaluate the ecosystem.
- **Talks & meetups** — A lightning talk or meetup about “modular DDD on Starlette” can link to Urich.

## Where to post (when you have something to show)

- [r/Python](https://reddit.com/r/Python) — “I built / released …” (follow sub rules).
